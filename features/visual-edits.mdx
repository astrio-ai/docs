- **Shadows** - Unified shadow styles for depth and elevation

### Responsive Design
Ensure your app looks great on all devices:

```text
Responsive Commands:
- "Hide this on mobile devices"
- "Stack these columns on tablets"
- "Make this text smaller on phones"
- "Show a hamburger menu on mobile"
- "Adjust this layout for desktop screens"
```

- **Live cursors** - See where teammates are working
- **Instant updates** - Changes appear for everyone in real-time
- **Design comments** - Add feedback directly on components
- **Version history** - Track all visual changes over time

### Design Review Process
Streamline design approval workflows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Design">
    Build your design using visual editing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share for Review">
    Send a link to stakeholders for feedback
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect Feedback">
    Reviewers can comment directly on components
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Changes">
    Apply feedback using natural language commands
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Features

### Animation and Transitions
Add motion to your designs:

```text
Animation Commands:
- "Fade in this element when it appears"
- "Add a slide-in animation from the left"
- "Make this button pulse when clicked"
- "Create a smooth transition between these pages"
- "Add a loading animation to this content"
```

### Custom Styling
For more control, combine visual editing with custom CSS:

```css
/* Generated from "Make this button more modern" */
.modern-button {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.25);
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.modern-button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(102, 126, 234, 0.35);
}
```

### Integration with Dev Mode
Seamlessly switch between visual and code editing:

- **Generated code** - See the code behind your visual changes
- **Code synchronization** - Manual code changes reflect in visual mode
- **Hybrid editing** - Combine both approaches for maximum flexibility

## Best Practices

### Design Efficiency
Maximize your productivity with visual editing:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="Start Simple"
    icon="seedling"
  >
    Begin with basic layouts and add complexity gradually
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Iterate Quickly"
    icon="repeat"
  >
    Make small changes and test frequently
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Think Mobile-First"
    icon="mobile"
  >
    Design for mobile screens first, then scale up
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Performance Considerations
Keep your designs optimized:

- **Image optimization** - Astrio automatically optimizes images you add
- **CSS efficiency** - Generated styles are optimized for performance
- **Responsive images** - Different sizes served based on device
- **Lazy loading** - Images load only when needed

<Tip>
Use descriptive language when making requests. Instead of "make it better," try "increase the font size and add more contrast for better readability."
</Tip>

<Warning>
Major layout changes might affect responsive behavior. Always test your changes on different screen sizes after making significant modifications.
</Warning>
