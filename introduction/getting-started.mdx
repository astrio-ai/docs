## Your First Project

### The Lifecycle of an Application

Every project in Astrio follows a simple flow:

**Plan & Design → Build or Modernize → Iterate → Publish**

### Step 1: Plan & Design

Before you start, think about what you want to create or modernize.

- **What is it?** (a portfolio website, a business dashboard, an old exisitng website that needs a fresh look)
- **Who is it for?** (yourself, your team, your customers)
- **What should it do?** (list features like “create tasks,” “show charts,” “send notifications”)
- **How should it look?** (clean, modern, playful, professional)

A little planning goes a long way. Even if you start with a simple idea, having answers to these questions helps Astrio give you better results.

### Step 2: Start Building or Modernizing

There are several ways to get started with Astrio, depending on your preferences and resources.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prompt">
    Astrio’s prompt-based system makes app creation and modernization simple.
      - Just describe what you want to build in the prompt box.
      - The more specific you are, the better the results.
      - Start with clear and detailed prompts.
      - You can refine and adjust your project as you go.
    
    <Note>
    Example:

    "I want to build a landing page for a bakery called Paris Bakery. It’s located in a small college town called Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. The goal of the site is to attract local students, families, and visitors by showing off the bakery’s story, menu, and contact details. Its features should include: a hero section with a warm welcome message, an about section telling the bakery’s story, a menu preview with photos of baked goods, a testimonials section for customer reviews, and a contact section with location, phone, and hours. It should have a cozy, Parisian-inspired aesthetic with warm colors, elegant fonts, and inviting photography. Users should be able to easily browse the menu, read about the bakery, and find directions. The site should be mobile-friendly and fast-loading. Users will access the site in their browser, so make sure it’s suitable for hosting on Netlify."
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Import Codebase">
    With Astrio, you can bring in your old codebase in two simple ways:
    - Upload it as a ZIP file.
    - Connect your GitHub account and link a repository.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using Figma">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open Figma">
        Use a design from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Take a Screenshot">
        Take a screenshot of your Figma design, then paste or drag-and-drop it into Astrio.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Let Astrio Handle the Rest">
        Our platform will transform your sketch into working code.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using a Sketch">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Sketch your UI">
        Use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) or any similar tool to sketch your UI.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Take a Screenshot">
        Take a screenshot of your drawing, then paste or drag-and-drop it into Astrio.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Let Astrio Handle the Rest">
        Our platform will transform your sketch into working code.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Iterate

After Astrio generates your application from your first prompt, you’ll probably want to make changes:
- Add more features.
- Tweak behavior or appearance.
- Fix bugs.

Remember. Do one thing at a time. Don’t try to add multiple features in one go.

### Step 4: Publish

When you're ready to go live, you can just publish it and get a shareable URL. You can use that URL showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.
