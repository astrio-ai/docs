## Understanding Tokens

<Steps>
  <Step title="What Are Tokens">
    Tokens are units of text processing used by AI models
  </Step>
  <Step title="Impact on Performance">
    Shorter content = fewer tokens = faster processing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Quality Over Quantity">
    Focus on essential information rather than verbose descriptions
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using .astrio/ignore

Create a `.astrio/ignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from processing:

```bash
node_modules/
.git/
*.log
temp/
build/
dist/
.env
.DS_Store
```

## Project Splitting

Break large projects into smaller, focused sections for better token efficiency:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Separate by Feature">
    Create dedicated files for specific functionality
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Clear Naming">
    Follow consistent file naming conventions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Group Related Content">
    Organize files by topic or purpose
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Structure

```
project/
├── components/
│   ├── header.mdx
│   ├── footer.mdx
│   └── navigation.mdx
├── features/
│   ├── authentication.mdx
│   ├── dashboard.mdx
│   └── settings.mdx
└── guides/
    ├── getting-started.mdx
    └── advanced-usage.mdx
```
